Firmware issues (07->08)
1. was initialising LED buffer before reading number of LEDs (so always 50) 
2. used some byte variables for counter that needed greater, and vice-versa
3. some possible issues because not all ISR modified variables were volatile
4. need to init SPI for each packet in case of lost/extra clock pulses
5. changed timer code to avoid firing test pattern during SPI receive
6. always accept 50 pixel SPI packets, and pad/extend colour data as needed

Sketch uses:
 20MHz: 11,194 bytes flash (34% of 32,256)
 16MHz: 11,290 bytes flash (36% of 30,720)
Global variables:
 1,308 bytes RAM

Host issues
1. used byte variable to count number of bytes to send, so max was 85
